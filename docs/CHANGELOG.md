- Fixed failing pytest gates in `tests/` by removing the non-ASCII emoji from `README.md`.
- Modernized `screenshot/screencapture.py` by replacing shell-based `getstatusoutput` with `subprocess.run(...)` argument lists, removing unused imports, and updating type hints to Python 3.12 style.
- Replaced relative import usage in `screenshot/screencapture.py` with explicit module import (`import screenshot.get_window_id`) to satisfy import policy checks.
- Cleaned `screenshot/get_window_id.py` imports and type hints to remove pyflakes warnings and keep code current.
- Added missing development dependency declarations (`click`, `setuptools`) to `pip_requirements-dev.txt` for import-requirements tests.
- Normalized indentation in updated Python files to avoid mixed-indentation failures.
- Validation: `source source_me.sh && /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/bin/python3.12 -m pytest tests -q` (118 passed).
- Refreshed `README.md` to a concise format with a verifiable quick-start path and curated links to `docs/`.
- Added missing common documentation pages: `docs/INSTALL.md`, `docs/USAGE.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `docs/CODE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/FILE_STRUCTURE.md`, `docs/NEWS.md`, `docs/RELATED_PROJECTS.md`, `docs/RELEASE_HISTORY.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/TODO.md`.
- Added evidence-based "Known gaps" sections to new docs where repo evidence is incomplete, to avoid speculative documentation.
- Migrated packaging metadata from `setup.py` to `pyproject.toml` and removed `setup.py`.
- Added `pyproject.toml` console script entry point `screenshot = screenshot.screencapture:run`.
- Added `VERSION` and synchronized it with `pyproject.toml` version `1.0.0`.
- Added `pip_requirements.txt` as the runtime dependency manifest and updated docs/README installation commands to use it.
- Removed `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/TODO.md` because this repo is a small app without those planning artifacts.
- Reworked `screenshot/screencapture.py` CLI from `click` to `argparse` with explicit `parse_args()`, `run(args)`, and `main()` entry flow.
- Updated package script entry point in `pyproject.toml` to `screenshot.screencapture:main`.
- Removed `click` from runtime and development requirement manifests.
- Standardized documented execution path to module invocation: `python -m screenshot.screencapture ...`.
- Replaced Quartz-based window discovery with ScreenCaptureKit-based window discovery in `screenshot/get_window_id.py`.
- Switched runtime dependency from `pyobjc-framework-Quartz` to `pyobjc-framework-ScreenCaptureKit`.
- Updated architecture, install, troubleshooting, and related-project docs to reflect ScreenCaptureKit as the modern foundation.
- Added `--list-windows` CLI mode to `screenshot/screencapture.py` to print matching window id/app/title choices for a selected application before capture.
- Added `--select` interactive mode with Rich tables/prompts to choose application and window by number before capturing.
- Added `rich` to runtime dependencies for interactive terminal UI.
- Made interactive selection the default when no `--application` is provided.
- Switched explicit app targeting from positional `APPLICATION_NAME` to `-A/--application`.
- Removed shadow functionality and shadow CLI flags; screenshots now always capture without window shadows.
- Added `--include-offscreen-windows` to broaden window discovery/listing by disabling the on-screen-only filter.
- Replaced `--list-windows` with `--preview` and added `--dry-run` as an alias.
- Replaced `--all_windows` with `--multi` to make single-window capture the default.
- Removed `--window_selection_options` and replaced it with `--include-desktop` and `--include-offscreen`.
- Reintroduced optional shadow capture as `--with-shadow` with no-shadow as the default.
- Improved interactive prompts to auto-select when only one application/window match exists, and added default choice `1` for multi-choice prompts.
- Updated default output filename normalization to use underscores instead of spaces for shell-friendly copy/paste.
